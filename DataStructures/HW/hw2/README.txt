DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
Please be concise! (< 200 words)
What question you are trying to answer with your statistic?
I tried to focus on the penalty time in the file.

What data did you need to organize? 
I needed to get the total penalty time and each school's individual penalty time.

What was interesting or challenging about the implementation of this statistic? 
I have to write a third class because I cannot have two differently defined operator<< in the same class.
This class isn't properly implemented because some files may have no penalties and that cause the program to break.
The stensil is there, but it was commented out
