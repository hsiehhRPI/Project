- I have to deeply apologize, I got helped on Tuesday night by a ds helper in lally 102 but I did not record his name, 
	I don't think we could go back a day on submitty office hours queue, 
	so I don't know if there is any other way of getting his name

DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SHIPFREIGHT ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimal (fastest train speed, most freight, fewest number
of engines used, and fewest resulting trains) for any input.  Note:
Student choice on how to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your
priorization and your implementation.

To minimize the number of engine needed in total, 
the equation to calculate speed was rearranged to work out the number of engines. 
The second priority was to minimize the number of freight trains needed. 
This condition was achieved by loading as much freight onto the train as long as the
minimum speed and max number of cars are met.


DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SEPARATE ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimally comfortable trains (smaller values for average
distance to dining and/or larger values for closest engine to sleeper)
and/or optimally handling cases with > 2 engines.  Student choice on how 
to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your priorization and your
implementation.


MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!
I really struggled with this homework. It had a lot of corner cases and I started early.
I think it will take some time for me to use doubly link list well.
