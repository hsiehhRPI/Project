-Each engine weighs 150 tons and has 3000hp
- Types of freight cars(weigh varies):
	- Unmarked cars are passenger cars
	- 
- Other cars weigh 50 tons
- Can have multiple engines(can be positioned anywhere)
- DO NOT edit traincar.h
- 
Tasks:
------Basics------
- Calculaute maximum speed on 2% incline
	- Formula given
- Calculate average distance to dining
	- Smaller number = better
- Calculate average distance from sleeping car to engine
	- Bigger number = better
- Represent infinite statisitcs using negative val

------Task1------
- Write a function called std::vector<Trains>ShipeFright(4 arg)
	- First two are TrainCar pointers: (collection of engine, collection fo freight cars)
	- Third: minimum speed
	- Fourth: max num of cars allowed per train
- MUST ACHIEVE MINIMUM SPEED AND MAX CAR REQUIREMENTS

------Task2------
- Function: Separate()
	- Speed should be nearly equal
	- Minimize cost of link/unlink
- Draw diagrams(MUST, bring the drawing to lab7, it is one of the checkpoints)
- Code should NOT create New Nodes
- NO editing of types of train cars
- There is a helper function that counts link and unlinks

- Splitting one train into multiple small train
- ASSUMPTION: 
	- Exactly two engines for the big train
	- Cost 1 money unit to: unlink/link/drag/shift

------Extra credit------
